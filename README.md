# Black-Scholes Model with Monte Carlo Simulation

## Overview

This project implements a C++ Black-Scholes model to calculate option pricing using a Monte Carlo simulation. It employs Cholesky matrix decomposition for efficient computation, utilizes the Boost library for generating random values, and provides seamless user input for stock values related to both call and put options.

## Features

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Generates multiple matrix paths to simulate stock price movements, allowing for accurate option pricing.
- **Cholesky Matrix Decomposition**: Enhances computational efficiency by transforming covariance matrices, ensuring faster calculations.
- **Boost Library Integration**: Utilizes the Boost library to generate high-quality random values for the simulations.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Enables users to input stock values effortlessly, facilitating real-time analysis.
- **Fast Greek Value Generation**: Quickly calculates and outputs Greek values, providing insights into option sensitivity and risk management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Boost Library (ensure it's installed and configured)
- CMake (optional for build management)


# Example Outputs

Enter stock price: 100
Enter strike price: 100
